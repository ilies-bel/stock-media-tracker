## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure the development server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The tests are configured to start the dev server automatically, but you can run it manually if needed.

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Show test report (after running tests)
npm run test:e2e:report

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test landing-page-core.spec.ts

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run tests on specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

## Test Configuration

The tests are configured to run on:
- **Desktop**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Mobile**: Chrome (Pixel 5), Safari (iPhone 12)

Configuration is in `playwright.config.ts`:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Auto-starts dev server
- Captures screenshots on failure
- Records traces on retry

## Test Data

The tests use realistic test data:
- Email addresses: `test@example.com`, `mobile@example.com`, etc.
- Creator count validation (starts around 187+ base count)
- Feature descriptions and UI text matching actual content

## Debugging Tests

### View Test Results
After running tests, view the HTML report:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Debug Failed Tests
1. Run with `--debug` flag to pause execution
2. Use `--headed` to see browser actions
3. Check screenshots in `test-results/` folder
4. Review traces in the HTML report

### Common Issues
- **Tests fail to find elements**: Check if UI text changed
- **Timing issues**: Adjust `waitForTimeout` values
- **Modal doesn't open**: Verify button selectors match current markup
- **Mobile tests fail**: Check viewport-specific styling

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments:
- Headless by default
- Retry failed tests (2x on CI)
- Generate artifacts (screenshots, traces, reports)
- Exit codes for build pipeline integration

## Maintenance

When updating the landing page:
1. **Text changes**: Update test assertions to match new copy
2. **UI changes**: Update selectors if component structure changes
3. **New features**: Add corresponding test cases
4. **Performance**: Monitor test execution time and optimize selectors

## Best Practices

The tests follow Playwright best practices:
- Use semantic selectors (`getByRole`, `getByText`)
- Wait for elements properly (`expect().toBeVisible()`)
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use descriptive test names and groupings
